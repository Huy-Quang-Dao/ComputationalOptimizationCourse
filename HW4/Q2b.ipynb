In other words, given\n","any subset S of nodes with source node $s \\in S$, let T be the set of the remaining nodes. The cut (S, T ) is the set of edges $ e = (u, v)$ with $u \\in S$ and $v \\in  T$. It is so-called because removing all those edges in the cut would cut the flow from s to t. Let c(e), $e \\in E$ be the capacity of the edge, i.e., the maximum amount of commodity that one can push through the edge. Let $x_k$, $\\forall$ $k \\in V$ be a variable corresponding to the vertices and let $y_e$,  $\\forall$ $e =(u,v) \\in E$ be a variable corresponding to the edges. The min-cut problem can be formulated as the following:\n","\n","\\begin{align*}\n","\\text{minimize} \\quad & \\sum_{e \\in E} c(e) y_e \\\\\n","\\text{subject to} \\quad & x_u - x_v + y_e \\geq 0 \\quad \\forall e=(u, v) \\in E \\\\\n","& -x_s + x_t \\geq 1 \\\\\n","& x_v \\in \\mathbb{R} \\quad \\forall v \\in V \\\\\n","& y_e \\geq 0 \\quad \\forall e \\in E\n","\\end{align*}\n","\n","For the directed graph given below, solve the min-cut problem using Pyomo"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"GBUsJm1_FOqn","outputId":"c533e5d8-143b-49b2-acd3-a3a5c4affb26"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<img src=\"fig1.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\"/>"],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Image object>"]},"execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# import image module\n","from IPython.display import Image\n","\n","# get the image\n","Image(url=\"fig1.png\", width=500, height=300)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"hSvpumgqFOqq","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1740754989541,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":4351,"user":{"displayName":"Quang Huy Đào","userId":"17473580993438237657"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# Including Libraries\n","\n","from pyomo.environ import *\n","import numpy as np\n","import pprint"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!apt-get install -y -qq glpk-utils"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"lHRcsMhCFQZa","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1740755014945,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":25386,"user":{"displayName":"Quang Huy Đào","userId":"17473580993438237657"}},"outputId":"058a08cf-af7f-4a28-a992-2e593d93957c"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Selecting previously unselected package libsuitesparseconfig5:amd64.\n","(Reading database ... 124947 files and directories currently installed.)\n","Preparing to unpack .../libsuitesparseconfig5_1%3a5.10.1+dfsg-4build1_amd64.deb ...\n","Unpacking libsuitesparseconfig5:amd64 (1:5.10.1+dfsg-4build1) ...\n","Selecting previously unselected package libamd2:amd64.\n","Preparing to unpack .../libamd2_1%3a5.10.1+dfsg-4build1_amd64.deb ...\n","Unpacking libamd2:amd64 (1:5.10.1+dfsg-4build1) ...\n","Selecting previously unselected package libcolamd2:amd64.\n","Preparing to unpack .../libcolamd2_1%3a5.10.1+dfsg-4build1_amd64.deb ...\n","Unpacking libcolamd2:amd64 (1:5.10.1+dfsg-4build1) ...\n","Selecting previously unselected package libglpk40:amd64.\n","Preparing to unpack .../libglpk40_5.0-1_amd64.deb ...\n","Unpacking libglpk40:amd64 (5.0-1) ...\n","Selecting previously unselected package glpk-utils.\n","Preparing to unpack .../glpk-utils_5.0-1_amd64.deb ...\n","Unpacking glpk-utils (5.0-1) ...\n","Setting up libsuitesparseconfig5:amd64 (1:5.10.1+dfsg-4build1) ...\n","Setting up libamd2:amd64 (1:5.10.1+dfsg-4build1) ...\n","Setting up libcolamd2:amd64 (1:5.10.1+dfsg-4build1) ...\n","Setting up libglpk40:amd64 (5.0-1) ...\n","Setting up glpk-utils (5.0-1) ...\n","Processing triggers for man-db (2.10.2-1) ...\n","Processing triggers for libc-bin (2.35-0ubuntu3.8) ...\n","/sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/local/lib/libtcm.so.1 is not a symbolic link\n","\n","/sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/local/lib/libur_adapter_opencl.so.0 is not a symbolic link\n","\n","/sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/local/lib/libumf.so.0 is not a symbolic link\n","\n","/sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/local/lib/libtbb.so.12 is not a symbolic link\n","\n","/sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/local/lib/libur_loader.so.0 is not a symbolic link\n","\n","/sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/local/lib/libtbbbind_2_0.so.3 is not a symbolic link\n","\n","/sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/local/lib/libtcm_debug.so.1 is not a symbolic link\n","\n","/sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/local/lib/libtbbbind.so.3 is not a symbolic link\n","\n","/sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/local/lib/libtbbmalloc.so.2 is not a symbolic link\n","\n","/sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/local/lib/libhwloc.so.15 is not a symbolic link\n","\n","/sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/local/lib/libtbbbind_2_5.so.3 is not a symbolic link\n","\n","/sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/local/lib/libur_adapter_level_zero.so.0 is not a symbolic link\n","\n","/sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/local/lib/libtbbmalloc_proxy.so.2 is not a symbolic link\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"id":"bpsL2DNXFOqq","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1740755014953,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":12,"user":{"displayName":"Quang Huy Đào","userId":"17473580993438237657"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# Create a Pyomo Model\n","model = ConcreteModel()\n","\n","# Define sets\n","\n","model.v = RangeSet(0,5)\n","\n","edges = [(0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,4), (3,2), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5)] #

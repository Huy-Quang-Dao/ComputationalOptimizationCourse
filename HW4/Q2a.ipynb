Let $e = (u, v) \\in E$ be an edge for vertex $u$ to vertex $v$, we define $e \\in \\delta^+ (v)$ to be the set of all outgoing edges to vertex $v$ and $e \\in \\delta^- (v)$ to be the set of all incoming nodes from vertex $v$. Let $c(e), \\ e \\in E$ be the capacity of the edge, i.e., the maximum amount of commodity that one can push through the edge. Let $f(e)$ be the flow across an edge $e$. $f(e)$ is non-negative as the flow in the edge cannot flow in the reverse direction i.e., towards the source. Also, the flow across each node should be conserved. In other words, the flow coming into a node has to be equal to the flow leaving the node. This conservation property does not apply to the source node $(s)$ and the sink node $(t)$. Formulating a linear programming problem to maximize the overall flow departing from the source node leads us to the formulation provided below:\n","\n","\\begin{array}{lll}\n","\\text{max} & \\sum_{e \\in \\delta^{+}(s)} f(e) - \\sum_{e \\in \\delta^{-}(s)} f(e) & \\\\ \\\\\n","\\text{subject to} & \\sum_{e \\in \\delta^{-}(v)} f(e) = \\sum_{e \\in \\delta^{+}(v)} f(e) & \\forall v \\in V \\setminus \\{s, t\\}\\quad \\quad \\text{  (flow conservation)} \\\\ \\\\\n","& f(e) \\leq c(e) & \\forall e \\in E \\quad \\quad \\text{  (capacity constraints)}\\\\ \\\\\n","& f(e) \\geq 0 & \\forall e \\in E\n","\\end{array}\n","\n","For the directed graph given below, solve the max-flow problem using Pyomo\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"jmC9s7zlDGK7","outputId":"9ac1377e-aa99-41a1-95d8-3aca1c15a7c9"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<img src=\"fig1.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\"/>"],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Image object>"]},"execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# import image module\n","from IPython.display import Image\n","\n","# get the image\n","Image(url=\"fig1.png\", width=500, height=300)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"6dkJ4BkXDGK8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1740754444664,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":3842,"user":{"displayName":"Quang Huy Đào","userId":"17473580993438237657"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# Including Libraries\n","\n","from pyomo.environ import *\n","import numpy as np\n","import pprint"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!apt-get install -y -qq glpk-utils"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"seUQT5E6DMEO","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1740754474979,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":14970,"user":{"displayName":"Quang Huy Đào","userId":"17473580993438237657"}},"outputId":"6a115da6-fd37-4f06-f69e-9489542f0d37"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Selecting previously unselected package libsuitesparseconfig5:amd64.\n","(Reading database ... 124947 files and directories currently installed.)\n","Preparing to unpack .../libsuitesparseconfig5_1%3a5.10.1+dfsg-4build1_amd64.deb ...\n","Unpacking libsuitesparseconfig5:amd64 (1:5.10.1+dfsg-4build1) ...\n","Selecting previously unselected package libamd2:amd64.\n","Preparing to unpack .../libamd2_1%3a5.10.1+dfsg-4build1_amd64.deb ...\n","Unpacking libamd2:amd64 (1:5.10.1+dfsg-4build1) ...\n","Selecting previously unselected package libcolamd2:amd64.\n","Preparing to unpack .../libcolamd2_1%3a5.10.1+dfsg-4build1_amd64.deb ...\n","Unpacking libcolamd2:amd64 (1:5.10.1+dfsg-4build1) ...\n","Selecting previously unselected package libglpk40:amd64.\n","Preparing to unpack .../libglpk40_5.0-1_amd64.deb ...\n","Unpacking libglpk40:amd64 (5.0-1) ...\n","Selecting previously unselected package glpk-utils.\n","Preparing to unpack .../glpk-utils_5.0-1_amd64.deb ...\n","Unpacking glpk-utils (5.0-1) ...\n","Setting up libsuitesparseconfig5:amd64 (1:5.10.1+dfsg-4build1) ...\n","Setting up libamd2:amd64 (1:5.10.1+dfsg-4build1) ...\n","Setting up libcolamd2:amd64 (1:5.10.1+dfsg-4build1) ...\n","Setting up libglpk40:amd64 (5.0-1) ...\n","Setting up glpk-utils (5.0-1) ...\n","Processing triggers for man-db (2.10.2-1) ...\n","Processing triggers for libc-bin (2.35-0ubuntu3.8) ...\n","/sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/local/lib/libtcm.so.1 is not a symbolic link\n","\n","/sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/local/lib/libur_adapter_opencl.so.0 is not a symbolic link\n","\n","/sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/local/lib/libumf.so.0 is not a symbolic link\n","\n","/sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/local/lib/libtbb.so.12 is not a symbolic link\n","\n","/sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/local/lib/libur_loader.so.0 is not a symbolic link\n","\n","/sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/local/lib/libtbbbind_2_0.so.3 is not a symbolic link\n","\n","/sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/local/lib/libtcm_debug.so.1 is not a symbolic link\n","\n","/sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/local/lib/libtbbbind.so.3 is not a symbolic link\n","\n","/sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/local/lib/libtbbmalloc.so.2 is not a symbolic link\n","\n","/sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/local/lib/libhwloc.so.15 is not a symbolic link\n","\n","/sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/local/lib/libtbbbind_2_5.so.3 is not a symbolic link\n","\n","/sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/local/lib/libur_adapter_level_zero.so.0 is not a symbolic link\n","\n","/sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/local/lib/libtbbmalloc_proxy.so.2 is not a symbolic link\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"id":"G3GzFo5ADGK9","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1740754503913,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":17,"user":{"displayName":"Quang Huy Đào","userId":"17473580993438237657"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# Create a Pyomo Model\n","model = ConcreteModel()\n","\n","# Define Sets\n","model.v = RangeSet(0,5)\n","\n","edges = [(0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,4), (3,2), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5)] #

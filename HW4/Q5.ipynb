for all $i$ in the range $(1,4)$, along with the symmetry constraint $X_{ij} = X_{ji}$ for all pairs $(i,j)$ where $i,j$ range from $1$ to $3$ and $i \\neq j$. Consequently, the problem remains unbounded during this initial phase. This occurs due to the presence of the term $1 - X_{ij}$ in the objective function, where $X_{ij}$ represents the off-diagonal elements. Without bounds on these elements, when these elements are multiplied by a positive quantity $Q_{ij}$, they have the potential to approach $-\\infty$, thereby causing the objective value to tend towards $+\\infty$, rendering the problem unbounded.
